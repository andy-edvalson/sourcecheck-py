PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital Signs: BP 138/85, HR 78, RR 16, Temp 98.6Â°F, O2 Sat 98% on room air

ASSESSMENT:
Based on the history and physical examination, the patient's presentation is most consistent with costochondritis. The sharp, positional chest pain with point tenderness over the sternal border is characteristic. Cardiac causes are less likely given the nature of the pain and lack of associated symptoms, though we cannot completely rule out cardiac etiology without further testing.

PLAN:
1. Recommend ibuprofen 400mg three times daily for pain and inflammation
2. Advise rest and avoid activities that worsen the pain
3. Apply heat or ice to the affected area as needed
4. Follow up in 1 week if symptoms persist or worsen
5. Return immediately if develops shortness of breath, severe pain, or other concerning symptoms
6. Consider EKG and cardiac enzymes if symptoms do not improve

Patient verbalized understanding of the plan and agreed to follow up as scheduled.
