        entity_boost: 0.20           # 20% boost for matching age + gender (handles "56 female" vs "56-year-old woman")

    temporal_drift_validator: 0.8      # 80% weight - high priority for temporal accuracy

    nli_validator: 0.3                 # 30% weight - good for catching contradictions

# Quality analysis modules
quality_modules:
  - name: semantic_quality
    min_quality_score: 0.95      # Analyze if quality_score < 0.95 (validator disagreement)
    min_confidence: 0.75         # Analyze if confidence < 0.75 (validator uncertainty)
    analyze_insufficient: true   # Always analyze insufficient_evidence verdicts
    max_issues: 3                # Report up to 3 issues per claim
    min_phrase_length: 2         # Minimum words in a phrase to report
  
  - name: temporal_numeric_drift
    min_quality_score: 1.1       # Always analyze (set > 1.0 to always trigger)
    tolerance_percent: 10        # Allow 10% numeric difference
    check_temporal: true         # Check temporal adverbs
    check_numeric: true          # Check numeric values
    max_issues: 3                # Report up to 3 issues per claim

# Confidence penalty for quality issues
quality_confidence_penalty: 0.9  # Multiply confidence by 0.9 when drift detected

# Scoring configuration
scoring:
  method: "quality_weighted"  # Options: "simple", "quality_weighted"
  # Note: quality_weighted multiplies each claim's verdict by its quality_score
  # This ensures low-quality claims (with drift/issues) reduce the overall score
